# manet-sim
An open-source, lightweight project for real-time visualisation and simulation of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Devices are shown as circles, with lines representing peer-to-peer wireless connections. In-range nodes automatically connect and exchange messages, modeling dynamic P2P communication.
